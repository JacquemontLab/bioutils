Compare two CNV datasets.

This script takes two CNV call tables (TSV format) and compares them on two levels:

1. Reciprocal CNV overlap (â‰¥ 50% in both directions):
   - A CNV in dataset A is considered overlapping with one in dataset B if:
       overlap_length >= 50% of length_A AND
       overlap_length >= 50% of length_B
   - Requires matching SampleID, chromosome, and CNV type.

2. Gene-level match:
   - If both datasets contain a Gene_ID column, flags CNVs where
     SampleID, Type, and Gene_ID are all identical in the other dataset.

Outputs:
--------
Two TSV files (one for each input), containing:
    - CNV_based_overlap : 1 if reciprocal overlap found, else 0
    - gene_based_overlap    : 1 if gene match found, NA if Gene_ID not available

Typical use case:
-----------------
Useful for comparing CNV calls from different platforms (e.g. array vs WGS)
or different calling methods to assess concordance.

Each input file must:
    - Be a tab-separated file (.tsv)
    - Contain these mandatory columns:
        SampleID : string, sample identifier (must match between datasets)
        Chr      : string/int, chromosome name (same naming convention in both files)
        Start    : integer, start coordinate (consistent 0-based or 1-based)
        End      : integer, end coordinate (must be > Start)
        Type     : string, CNV type (e.g., DEL, DUP)
    - (Optional) Gene_ID : string, gene identifier (required for gene match comparison)

Example:
--------
python compare_cnv_calls.py \
    --file_a array_calls.tsv \
    --file_b wgs_calls.tsv \
    --out_a array_with_flags.tsv \
    --out_b wgs_with_flags.tsv
